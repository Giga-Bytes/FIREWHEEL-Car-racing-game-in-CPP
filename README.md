# FIREWHEEL-Car-racing-game-in-CPP-
FIREWHEEL is the car racing game that I coded when I was 18. It was fun to code this for the first time and was appreciated by a lot of people. I have been thinking of making it open source since many days and here it comes one!

To run this game, you will need Turbo C3 and a windows machine. Once you install Turbo C3, open source file FIREWHEEL.cpp and go to line number 61. Change BGI path if needed. I have wrote the default one.

Please leave comments and create issue tickets if any.
